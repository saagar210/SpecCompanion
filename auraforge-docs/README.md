# Spec Companion

Generated by AuraForge on 2024-12-19

## What Is This?

This folder contains the documentation and planning assets for the Spec Companion desktop application. The application is built with Tauri and designed to help developers manage technical specifications and ensure code alignment. It accepts spec documents, connects to codebases, generates test scenarios, runs tests, and reports on spec-to-code alignment.

## Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | This file - project overview and usage instructions |
| `SPEC.md` | Detailed project specification and requirements |
| `LICENSE` | Project licensing information |
| `package.json` | Project metadata and dependencies |
| `src/` | Source code directory |
| `docs/` | Documentation files |

## How to Use

1. Install Rust and Node.js dependencies
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies
4. Run `cargo build` to build the Tauri application
5. Launch the application using `npm run tauri dev` for development
6. Create a new project by uploading spec documents and connecting to your codebase
7. Generate test scenarios and execute tests to check alignment
8. Review the alignment reports for mismatches and coverage metrics

## Project Overview

Spec Companion is a desktop application built with Tauri that helps developers manage technical specifications and ensure code alignment. It accepts spec documents (SPEC.md, requirements files), connects to codebases manually, generates test scenarios from specs, runs tests against implementation, and reports on spec-to-code alignment. The application stores projects locally and supports multiple testing frameworks including JAST and PyTest.

## Key Decisions

- Built with Tauri framework for cross-platform desktop application
- Target audience: developers working with technical specifications
- Primary spec types: technical specs (SPEC.md, requirements files)
- Testing frameworks supported: JAST, PyTest, and multiple others
- Manual upload workflow for spec documents and codebase connection
- Version control integration (git) for project management
- Local storage approach for project persistence
- Web-based frontend with React/TypeScript for UI
- Rust backend for system operations and file handling
- Modular phased approach for development (12-week roadmap)
